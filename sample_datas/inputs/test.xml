        <head>Chapter One: Arrival at the Monastery</head>

        <p>
          <pb n="1r"/>
          In the valley below the snow mountains stood
          <placeName ref="#monastery">Serene Peak Monastery</placeName>,
          where <persName ref="#elder">the Elder Monk</persName>
          taught the discipline of conduct and contemplation.
        </p>

        <p>
          One autumn morning, a young novice named
          <persName ref="#novice">Jampa</persName>
          arrived from <placeName ref="#village">Cloud Valley</placeName>.
          He bowed before <persName ref="#abbot">the Abbot</persName> and said,
          <q>Venerable sir, I wish to study the teachings and train my mind.</q>
        </p>

        <p>
          The abbot replied,
          <q>
            Study begins not with many words, but with careful attention.
            Stay near <persName ref="#elder">the Elder Monk</persName>,
            and observe how he walks, speaks, and keeps silence.
          </q>
        </p>

        <p>
          That evening, <persName ref="#novice">Jampa</persName> followed the elder
          to the assembly hall. On the wall hung an old inscription reading
          <foreign xml:lang="sa">धर्म</foreign>,
          explained in the margin by a later hand as
          <gloss xml:lang="en">teaching, law, reality</gloss>.
        </p>

        <note place="margin">
          The Sanskrit word here is intentionally brief to show how foreign-language
          elements may be marked.
        </note>
      </div>

      <div type="chapter" n="2" xml:id="ch2">
        <head>Chapter Two: The Lesson of the Lamp</head>

        <p>
          <pb n="2r"/>
          At dawn, <persName ref="#elder">the Elder Monk</persName>
          lit a butter lamp and placed it before an image of the Buddha.
          Seeing the novice watching, he asked,
          <q>What do you see?</q>
        </p>

        <p>
          <persName ref="#novice">Jampa</persName> answered,
          <q>I see the flame, bright and steady.</q>
          The elder said,
          <q>
            Look again. The flame is steady only because it is constantly changing.
            In the same way, the mind seems continuous, yet every thought arises and passes.
          </q>
        </p>

        <p>
          The novice wrote these words in his notebook, but later the line was copied
          wrongly as
          <choice>
            <sic>every thought arises and remains</sic>
            <corr>every thought arises and passes</corr>
          </choice>.
          An editor has corrected it here.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside, the wind moved through the pine trees of
          <placeName ref="#forest">Pine Forest Hermitage</placeName>.
          The elder recited the following verse:
        </p>

        <lg type="verse">
          <l>The lamp burns clear when guarded from the wind.</l>
          <l>The mind grows clear when guarded from distraction.</l>
          <l>One who watches rising and falling carefully</l>
          <l>Finds peace not made by circumstances.</l>
        </lg>

        <note type="commentary">
          This verse is not from a canonical source; it is included here only as an
          example of verse encoding in TEI.

      <div type="chapter" n="3" xml:id="ch3">
        <head>Chapter Three: The Journey to the Village</head>

        <p>
          <pb n="3r"/>
          Some weeks later, the elder and the novice traveled to
          <placeName ref="#village">Cloud Valley</placeName>
          to collect medicine for a sick monk.
          The path was steep, and the novice complained of hunger.
        </p>

        <p>
          <persName ref="#elder">The Elder Monk</persName> said,
          <q>
            Hunger is known by the body, complaint is added by the mind.
            Learn to distinguish sensation from reaction.
          </q>
        </p>

        <p>
          Near the river they met a householder woman who offered them soup.
          Her name is lost in the manuscript;
          <gap reason="illegible" quantity="2" unit="words"/>.
          She requested a blessing for her son.
        </p>

        <p>
          The elder placed his hand above the child’s head and spoke gently.
          A later annotator added:
          <note resp="#abbot">
            This passage is often cited in village preaching to illustrate compassion
            expressed through ordinary encounters.
          </note>
        </p>

        <p>
          In one witness of the text, the place name appears as
          <choice>
            <orig>Cloud Valley</orig>
            <reg>Cloudvale</reg>
          </choice>,
          but this edition keeps the more common form.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div type="chapter" n="4" xml:id="ch4">
        <head>Chapter Four: Unclear Words in the Night Teaching</head>

        <p>
          <pb n="4r"/>
          On their return, the monks stopped at a small rest house.
          After sunset, <persName ref="#novice">Jampa</persName> asked,
          <q>How can I know whether my practice is genuine?</q>
        </p>

        <p>
          The elder answered,
          <q>
            If pride increases, practice is weak.
            If greed increases, practice is crooked.
            If kindness increases, practice is maturing.
          </q>
        </p>

        <p>
          The manuscript becomes difficult to read here:
          <unclear>one should test the heart in ordinary moments</unclear>.
          The final phrase is partially damaged.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another copy preserves the sentence more fully:
          <quote>
            One should test the heart in ordinary moments, not only in meditation.
          </quote>
        </p>

        <p>
          The novice then remained silent for a long time.
          In the morning he confessed that he had secretly wished to be praised
          for his discipline.
        </p>

        <p>
          <persName ref="#elder">The Elder Monk</persName> smiled and replied,
          <q>To see vanity is already to loosen its grip.</q>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div type="chapter" n="5" xml:id="ch5">
        <head>Chapter Five: The Abbot’s Instruction</head>

        <p>
          <pb n="5r"/>
          Upon returning to
          <placeName ref="#monastery">Serene Peak Monastery</placeName>,
          the novice reported what he had learned.
          <persName ref="#abbot">The Abbot</persName> listened carefully and said:
        </p>

        <list type="bulleted">
          <item>Discipline protects practice.</item>
          <item>Reflection clarifies intention.</item>
          <item>Compassion gives practice its direction.</item>
        </list>

        <p>
          He then commanded the novice to sweep the courtyard each morning for one year,
          adding that no instruction is complete until it enters the body through repetition.
        </p>

        <p>
          A rubricated subheading in the manuscript reads:
          <hi rend="red">On the union of humility and diligence</hi>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some readers have taken this chapter as evidence that the novice later became
          a famous teacher, but the text itself does not say so.
          That conclusion belongs to later tradition.

          Thus ends <title>The Story of the Elder Monk</title>,
          a narrative on the training of intention, patience, and insight.
